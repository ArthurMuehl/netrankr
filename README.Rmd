## Overview

netrankr is an R package that is tailored for centrality analyses without necessarily relying on indices.

## Install

## Main Usage

The main function is `rank_analysis` which performs a complete analysis of a given partial order. This includes:

* Number of linear extensions (rankings)
* Rank probabilities: P(rk(u)=k) for all nodes and ranks
* Relative rank probabilities P(rk(u)<rk(v)) for all nodes
* Expected rank of nodes

`neighborhood_inclusion` and `positional_dominance` can be used to construct partial orders on a network. While `neighborhood_inclusion` is very specific (undirected, unweighted networks), `positional_dominance` can be used with any kind of input network. If cost variables (e.g. distances) are used, set  `benefit=F`. If actor identities don't matter set `map=T`.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Caveats

Finding/Enumerating all linear extension of a partial order is #P-complete, so be careful with bigger inputs, since your Computer might explode(literally!!)

There exist some approximate methods found with `approx_` that work brilliantly even on huge networks.
