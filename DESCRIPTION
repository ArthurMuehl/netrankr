Title: Analyzing Partial Rankings in Networks
Version: 0.0.5

Description: Implements methods for network centrality 
    related analyses of networks. While the package includes the possibility to
    build a variety of indices, its main focus lies on index-free assessment of centrality via partial 
    rankings obtained by neighborhood-inclusion or positional dominance. 
    These partial rankings can be analyzed with a variety of methods.
    These include probabilistic methods like computing expected node ranks and relative 
    rank probabilities (how likely is it that a node is more central than another?).
