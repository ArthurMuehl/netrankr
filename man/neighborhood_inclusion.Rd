\title{Neighborhood-Inclusion Preorder}
\usage{
neighborhood_inclusion(g)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{An igraph object}
}
\value{
the neighborhood-inclusion preorder of an undirected graph g
}
\description{
Calculates the neighborhood-inclusion preorder of an undirected graph
}
\details{
neighborhood-inclusion is formally defined as
\deqn{N(u)\subseteq N[v]}
where \eqn{N(u)} is the neighborhood of \eqn{u} and \eqn{N[v]=N(v)\cup \lbrace v\rbrace} is the closed neighborhood of \eqn{v}.
\eqn{N(u) \subseteq N[v]} implies that \eqn{c(u) \leq c(v)},
where \eqn{c} is an arbitrary centrality index. Neighborhood-inclusion is thus preserved in any centrality ranking.
