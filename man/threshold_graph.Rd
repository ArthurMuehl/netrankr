\usage{
threshold_graph(n, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{number of nodes}

\item{p}{fraction of dominating vertices. Equates approximately to the density of the graph}
}
\value{
a threshold graph as igraph object
}
\description{
Constructs a random threshold graph.
A threshold graph is a graph where the neighborhood inclusion preorder is complete.
}
\details{
Threshold graphs can be constructed with a binary sequence. For each 0, an isolated
vertex is inserted and for each 1, a vertex is inserted that connects to all previously inserted
vertices. An important property of threshold graphs is, that all centrality indices induce the same ranking.
}
\examples{
require(igraph)
g <- threshold_graph(10,0.3)
\dontrun{plot(g)}

# star graphs and complete graphs are threshold graphs
complete <- threshold_graph(10,1) #complete graph
\dontrun{plot(complete)}

star <- threshold_graph(10,0) #star graph
\dontrun{plot(star)}

# Centrality scores are perfectly rank correlated
cor(degree(g),closeness(g),method="kendall")
