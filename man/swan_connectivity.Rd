\title{Impact on connectivity when a node is removed}
\usage{
swan_connectivity(g)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{An \code{igraph} object representing the graph to analyze.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector where each entry represents the connectivity loss when the corresponding node is removed.
}
\description{
\code{swan_connectivity} measures the loss of connectivity when a node is removed from the network.
}
\details{
Connectivity loss indices quantify the decrease in the number of relationships between nodes
when one or more components are removed. \code{swan_connectivity} computes the connectivity loss
by systematically excluding each node and evaluating the resulting changes in the network structure.

The code is an adaptation from the NetSwan package that was archived on CRAN.
