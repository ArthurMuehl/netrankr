\title{Approximation of expected rankings}
\usage{
rank_approximation(P, method = "lpom")
}
\arguments{
\item{P}{a partial order as matrix object}

\item{method}{string indicating method to be used. see details}
}
\value{
a vector containing approximation of expected ranks
}
\description{
Implements a variety of functions to approximate expected ranks in large partially ordered sets
}
\details{
The \emph{method} parameter can be set to \emph{lpom}(simplest, most accurate for tiny networks),
\emph{glpom}(most accurate for tiny networks),\emph{loof1}(more accurate for large networks) or
\emph{loof2}(even more accurate for large networks)
