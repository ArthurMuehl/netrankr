\value{
A matrix containing indirect relations in a network.

\description{
Derive indirect relations for a given network.
Observed relations, like presents or absence of a relation, are commonly not the center
of analysis, but are transformed in a new set of indirect relation like shortest path
distances among nodes. These transformations are usually an implicit step when centrality
indices are used. Making this step explicit gives more possibilities, for example
calculating partial centrality rankings with \link{positional_dominance}.
}
\details{
The \code{type} parameter has the following options.

\emph{'identity'} returns the adjacency matrix of the network.

\emph{'dist_sp'} returns shortest path distances between all pairs of nodes.

\emph{'depend_sp'} returns dyadic dependencies
\deqn{\delta(u,s) = \sum_{t \in V} \frac{\sigma(s,t|u)}{\sigma(s,t)}}
where \eqn{\sigma(s,t|u)} is the number of shortest paths from s to t that include u and
\eqn{\sigma(s,t)} is the total number of shortest (s,t)-paths. This relation is used
for betweenness-like centrality indices.

\emph{'walks'} returns walk counts between pairs of nodes, usually they are
weighted decreasingly in their lengths or other properties which can be done by adding
a function in \code{FUN}.  See \link{transform_relations} for options.

\emph{'dist_resist'} returns the resistance distance between all pairs of nodes.

\emph{'dist_lf'} returns a logarithmic forest distance \eqn{d_\alpha(s,t)}. The logarithmic forest
distances form a one-parametric family converging to shortest path distances as \eqn{\alpha \to 0^+}
and to the resistance distance as \eqn{\alpha \to \infty}. See (Chebotarev, 2011) for more details.
The parameter \code{lfparam} can be used to tune \eqn{\alpha}.

\emph{'dist_rwalk'}

\emph{'depend_netflow'}

\emph{'depend_curflow'}

\emph{'depend_exp'}

\emph{'depend_rsps'}

\emph{'depend_rspn'}

The function \code{FUN} is used to transform the indirect
relation. See \link{transform_relations} for predefined functions and additional help.
